= CloudBees action: Register a build artifact

Use this action to report to the CloudBees platform that an artifact version has been created from a workflow run.
Register a build artifact to enable traceability, including if a branch and/or repository is checked out that is different from the workflow repository branch.
A unique artifact ID is output from using this action.

== Usage examples

=== Basic example

The following is a basic example of using the action:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  register_build_artifact:
      uses: cloudbees-io/register-build-artifact@v1
      with:
        name: "myApp"
        url: "docker.io/myapp/myimg:1.0.0"
        version: "1.0.0"

----

=== Using the action output

The following example uses the `artifact-id` output for downstream steps:

[source,yaml]
----
      - name: Checkout
        uses: cloudbees-io/checkout@v1
        id: checkout
      - name: Register an artifact with the platform
        uses: cloudbees-io/register-build-artifact@v1
        with:
          name: "myApp"
          version: "1.0.0"
          url: "docker.io/myapp/myimg:1.0.0"
          repository-url: ${{ steps.checkout.outputs.repository-url }}
          commit: ${{ steps.checkout.outputs.commit }}
          commit-url: ${{ steps.checkout.outputs.commit-url }}
          ref: ${{ steps.checkout.outputs.ref }}
----

=== Using optional inputs

The following example specifies the artifact digest and labels:

[source,yaml]
----
jobs:
  register_build_artifact:
      uses: https://github.com/cloudbees-io/register-build-artifact@v1
      with:
        name: "myApp"
        version: "1.0.0"
        url: "docker.io/myapp/myimg:1.0.0"
        digest: "sha256:1234567890abcdefghijklmnop1234567"
        labels: "label1,label2"
----

=== Full workflow example

The following workflow example uses the action to register a build artifact to the platform.
Then it xref:artifact-management:register-deployed-artifact.adoc[deploys the artifact] to the Docker `test` target environment and xref:evidence:publish-evidence-item.adoc[publishes evidence] to the platform.
